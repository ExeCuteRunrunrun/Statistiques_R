```
## Exercise_1
Get a little knowledge of R Markdown. 

R Markdown seems to be a cocktail of severals mark languages. Consult the cheatsheet [here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf).

### Note some shortcuts
* knit: `shift + cmmd + k`
* insert chunk: `alt + cmmd + I`
* comment lines: `shift + cmmd + c`
  
```{r echo=TRUE}
getRversion()
```
Below is the official introduction to R Markdown.

### R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
